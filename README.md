# Overview

The Braille Calculator uses a Makey Makey Classic, 3D printed Braille, and a scratch project to allow users to do simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division with audio feedback. The calculator allows the user to input a mathematical expression, guess the answer, and finally give the correct answer to compare with the user inputted answer and verify audibly if it was correct or incorrect. This device can be used with any PC, tablet, phone, or device with a USB (type-A) port, and internet connection.

# Usage

This device is intended for individuals that are visually impaired in an educational setting to practice math. The user is able to interact with an online calculator project created in Scratch that audibly interacts with their inputs using the brass contact points. The calculator includes 3D printed Braille labels of what each contact point represents. The calculator is capable of performing one multiplication, division, addition, or subtraction action at a time. This calculator is compatible with any device that has a USB (type-A) port and an internet connection.

An example of the usage of this device is in the downloadable section of this page.

# Build Instructions

SKILLS REQUIRED:

- 3D Printing
- Assembly

TOOLS:

- Glue (hot glue, stick glue, etc)
- 3D printer
- Scissors
- Ink Printer
- Wire stripper

# COMPONENTS

- (1x) Cardboard Box (8.5 x 11 x 3 inches)  Note: 3D print filament box works great
- (1x) Paper Printed with Braille Touchpad
- (19x) Alligator Clips (Note: The Makey Makey Classic this will come with 7 alligator clips) (https://www.amazon.ca/WGGE-WG-026-Pieces-Colors-Alligator/dp/B06XDM8BY1/ref=sr_1_20?dchild=1)
- (19x) 1-inch Brass Fasteners (https://www.amazon.ca/ACCO-Plated-Fastener-Fasteners-A7071710/dp/B004LWSFAK/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1)
- (x19) 3D printed Braille Labels

# 3D PRINTING

Device requires 19 3D printed Braille labels. These are quick and take minimal filament. The 3D print files are downloadable on this page and do not require supports to print. The 3D printing guide file gives recommendations on settings for a successful print.

# Attribution

Through our partnership with Makey Makey, Katie Butzu, and Mark Lyons, workshops were hosted to help disability professionals learn how they could gamify their work. Then we challenged these disability professionals to create their own assistive technology for clients! This project was created by Tracy Zhang and modified by the MMC team to include 3D printed Braille.
